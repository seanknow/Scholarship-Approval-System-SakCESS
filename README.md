# SakCESS: Scholarship-Approval-System

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The SakCESS Education to Success System is a Python based application that has been designed
to simplify and modernize the scholarship application process to students. Its first aim is to
provide an easy platform where applicants can easily provide their personal and academic
information without requiring them to make onsite and walks-in submissions. Traditional
scholarship procedures usually require that learners visit the office and fill the papers manually,
which is time-consuming, prone to error and inconvenient, especially to students, who may be
located in distant places. SakCESS will fill these gaps by offering an automated system which
will be able to manage data entry process, verification and record management with efficiency.

The system uses CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features and thus allows the students to
make handling of their information. The key characteristics include submitting forms digitally,
managing records systematically and user-friendly. By these features, the SakCESS system
allows the completion of scholarship applications to be done faster.

# PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Traditional scholarship applications require students to physically go to the office and manually fill out forms.
This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inconvenient—especially for students coming from distant areas.
SakCESS addresses this problem by providing an automated system that handles data entry, verification, and management through a computerized platform.

# KEY FEATURES
The system operates using CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—allowing easy management of student records.
- Digital Form Submission
- Record Management
- User-Friendly


PROJECT OBJECTIVES
● To create a python application that facilitates scholarship applications.
● To streamline the application process, reducing the need for physical submissions.
● To create a user-friendly digital platform for scholarship applications.
● To enhance the efficiency of managing and processing scholarship applications.
● To improve the overall experience for both applicants and administrators involved in the
scholarship process.
● To promote environmental sustainability by reducing paper usage through digital
applications.

# SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
● Python (latest version)
● Tkinter library for GUI development
● Xampp sql for database management
● PIL for ImageTK (Background Design)
● Design Application (Canva, Google Gemini, etc)
● Basic understanding of Python programming and database operations
● Internet access for downloading necessary libraries and tools
