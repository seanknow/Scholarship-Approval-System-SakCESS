# SakCESS: Scholarship-Approval-System

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The SakCESS—Education to Success System is a Python-based system designed to simplify and modernize the scholarship application process for students.
 Its main purpose is to provide a convenient digital platform where applicants can easily input their information without the need for onsite, walk-in submissions.
  Through this project, the traditional manual process becomes faster, more organized, and more accessible.   

# PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Traditional scholarship applications require students to physically go to the office and manually fill out forms.
This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inconvenient—especially for students coming from distant areas.
SakCESS addresses this problem by providing an automated system that handles data entry, verification, and management through a computerized platform.

# KEY FEATURES
The system operates using CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—allowing easy management of student records.
- Digital Form Submission
- Record Management
- User-Friendly Workflow
